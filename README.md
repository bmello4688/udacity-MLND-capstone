# udacity-MLND-capstone
Capstone project for udacity's machine learning nano degree program

Reference proposal.md or proposal.pdf to review the project details and approach

All required libraries are downloadable in the jupyter notebook. You may have to run the jupyter notebook app as an administrator for the libraries to download. Keras is used with tensorflow as the backend. It is highly recommended that you use the gpu for training because it is 4-5 times faster. It takes 15 min for a run all on the GPU and over an hour for the cpu. Comment out the tensorflow-gpu library on the first code line if you plan to use your CPU.

All the required data are located in the data folder as csv files.

All referenced external documents are in the folder "supporting documents and graphs"
